Solar-logger 

This package is based on solar-logger-0.2.1. The solar-logger has been patched to write into an sqlite3 database
and to retrieve data from a sunmeter in addition to SMA inverters.

For installation instructions see INSTALL.

If you have collected data in your sqlite3 database, you might want to synchronize it with the solar-logger server.
